## About

iplayed-backend is the backend module for our innovative developer group's projects. We focus on integrating gamification into engaging activity venues like escape rooms, axe throwing, and paintball, creating a blend of technology and entertainment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from here.

### Installation

1. [Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository):

   `git clone https://github.com/iplayed/iplayed-backend.git`

2. Ask on Discord for the `.env` file credentials if necessary and add it to your local copy.

3. Keep the `.env-template` file and create a `.env` file with the credentials. To use the key from the credentials file, use ` const EXAMPLE_KEY = process.env.EXAMPLE_KEY;`

4. Navigate to the project directory:

   `cd iplayed-backend`

5. Install dependencies:

   `npm install`

## Usage

To run the development server, use the following command:

`npm run dev`

This will start the Express development server and allow you to preview your backend.
